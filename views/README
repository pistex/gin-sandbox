Initially, I created these views for development purpose only.
These views were going to be copied and pasted into frontend framework.
But after I develop this app for a time.
I found that it is more convenient for me developing it this way than switching between two screen on running two development servers at the same time.

Anyway, the API itself is designed to support any frontend framework.
Also, it is way more powerful to use Vue cli than developing it this way.
